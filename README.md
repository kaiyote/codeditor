codeditor
=========
A much simpler take on my previous attempt at an editor, with all of the knowledge I've gained between then and now.

What this is:
-------------
A multi-file text editor with:
- Project View
- Memory of previously opened files
- Syntax Highlighting
- Themes
- Basically all the stuff that [Ace][1] lets you do

This editor has been strongly influenced by [Caret][2]. Caret is an amazing editor,
but unfortunately cannot be set as default editor on major Desktop OSes. Hopefully,
this editor will be able to be set as default editor at some point.

What this isn't:
----------------
1. Sublime. If you want Sublime keybindings, chances are you've already used Sublime, and chances are you've already bought Sublime.  Why are you using this?
2. Vim/Emacs. Same deal as Sublime, minus the whole paying-money-for-it thing.  Seriously, if you like those keybindings, why are you using this?

Future Plans / Yet to be Implemented:
-------------------------------------
- Integrated terminal
- Settings
- Project directory watching / Project tree auto-reload
